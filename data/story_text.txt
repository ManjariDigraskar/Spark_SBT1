The short story is a crafted form in its own right. Short stories make use of plot, resonance,
and other dynamic components as in a novel, but typically to a lesser degree. While the short story
is largely distinct from the novel or novella/short novel, authors generally draw from a common pool
of literary techniques.

Determining what exactly separates a short story from longer fictional formats is problematic. A classic
definition of a short story is that one should be able to read it in one sitting, a point most notably made
in Edgar Allan Poe's essay "The Philosophy of Composition" (1846).[1] According to William Faulkner, a short
story is character driven and a writer's job is to "...trot along behind him with a paper and pencil trying
to keep up long enough to put down what he says and does.‚Äù[2]

Some authors have argued that a short story must have a strict form. Somerset Maugham thought that the
short story "must have a definite design, which includes a point of departure, a climax and a point
of test; in other words, it must have a plot". This view is however opposed by Anton Chekov who
thought that a story should have neither a beginning nor an end. It should just be a "slice of life",
presented suggestively.[3] Sukumar Azhikode defined a short story as" a brief prose narrative with an
intense episodic or anecdotal effect".[4] Short story writers may define their works as part of the
artistic and personal expression of the form. They may also attempt to resist categorization by genre
and fixed formation.[3]

Short stories have deep roots and the power of short fiction has been recognized in modern society for
hundreds of years.
